## Forest Watch - Rainforest monitoring data science research project

Forest Watch research project aims to collect images and sound data from Brazilian forests, [Amazon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_rainforest) and [Mata Atlântica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Forest), to analyze and monitor biodiversity, risks, and threads such as fire, shots, and illegal activities such as logging, and poaching.

  - Off grid (solar painel power source)
  - Reporposed used smartphones
  - Lightweight case
  - Ping device on top of trees
  - Send data by 4G/5G
  - Mobile app to get sensors info
- Store sound data
- Analise sound data at the cloud
- Report
  - Mogile app
  - Papers
  - Graphics/Dashboard
  - Online real time data access
