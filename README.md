## Forest Watch - Rainforest monitoring data science research project

Forest Watch research project aims to collect images and sound data from Brazilian forests with remote sensing technology, [Amazon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_rainforest) and [Mata Atlântica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Forest), to analyze and monitor biodiversity, risks, and threads such as fire, shots, and illegal activities such as logging, and poaching.

Concept:

- Prototype data collection device
  - Off-grid (solar panel power source and/or batteries)
  - Repurposed used smartphones
  - Lightweight case
  - Ping device on top of trees
  - Send data by 4G/5G (When available)
  - Send data by satellite connection (When available)
  - Store data at a local SSD/Memory (offline data sample)
  - Mobile app to get sensors info
  - Low-cost hardware
- Store sound, image, and sensor data
- Annalise sound, image, and sensor data in the cloud
- Report
  - Mobile app
  - Papers
  - Graphics/Dashboard
  - Online real-time data access
